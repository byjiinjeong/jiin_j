                    This work is installed based on the interviews that I conducted. The interview was conducted in a friend's room and her room was recreated into the space where this installation work was carried out. As the interview was conducted on her mattress, I placed six frames containing the words from our interview and a mattress together to re-live the atmosphere in her room. Six illustrations and text from a friend's experience in Russia, and on the right side text from another friend's experience are displayed and exposed in combination with element symbols, to objectify mentioned emotions, instead of outwardly expressing them.

                    The colors that I extracted using the Ph test strips showed some degree of unity based on a series of square shapes and similar colors. This morphological sequence was reminiscent of plaid patterns, and the regularity of these types of information was used to add colors to the soccer goalpost, which is a good example of regular plaid patterns. However, this regularity is expressed in digital drawing as it can be broken down with color and expressed in a different way than just a series of square shapes.

                    I thought the process of how factoryized this chicken was in such a formal environment. Through this thought, I thought of many things that could have come from ‘wild' enough and wanted to say how many things in our daily lives are ‘manufactured’ and ‘formatted’. Perhaps many things could become more natural and beautiful when they had 'wildness'. The dried petals surrounding the chicken wing are not wild flowers either. It was also a product of a supermarket. Through this idea, I wanted to tell how easily something existing with ‘wildness’ becomes formalized and labeled these days.

                    My friend Saron always has a great passion for styling her hair and watching it always interests me. This hairstyle, which is both serial and multi-flowing, created by her braids, has become a visual inspiration for me, divided into several patterns.

                    Hangul(The Korean alphabet) has the principles of letters that consonants and vowels meet and form. Using an irregular stroke from Saron's head, a poster was made to learn the letters by listing the 14 most basic Korean characters.

                    Saron's braids have a series of regularities overall, but each twist has irregular details. Such visual characteristics were used to create tasks that looked like individual waves through various effects.

                    I found a pair of bees lying side by side near the window one day. I wondered why they were together side by side at the same place, but seeing them together, I recalled my past dead relationship. I thought I should bury the bees with the dead relationship. It served to close the chapter on my past by sending them through the indirect consciousness of burning various objects.

                    In 2020, when the first lock-down was implemented across Germany due to the outbreak of COVID-19, many people began to feel both boredom and fear. As a result, people who did not usually exercise started home training. This work talks about visual information about a human being frustrated by a sense of helplessness, although it seeks to achieve physical training through new physical movements based on restrictions on movements made by society's needs.

                    ‘6人6色’ means six people, six colors. I used several different liquids using the Ph test strips to create new colors that didn't exist before. Thus, I extracted various colors of each individual and created a visual combination with photographs of my acquaintances who had as distinct individuality as the individuality of the colors.

                    This work began by designing a new machine that would decompose a machine that I accidentally encountered and evaporate the liquid. I have constantly asked their views and experiences about 'erasing' through many interviews with acquaintances, and the stories they shared have always been my great inspiration. It has been mainly expressed as a physical or mental erasure and has been found to be expressed with words such as 'removal' or 'evaporation'. Through the homage of Joseph Kosuth's work, I try to explain the definition of erasure, but the word is also 'evaporated'.

                    One of my great inspirations begins with something very trivial and routine around me. It could be either my friends, pedestrians, or the street where I walk on, or it's through the colors or objects I happen to encounter. They all tell me their own stories.
